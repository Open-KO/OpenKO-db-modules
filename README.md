# OpenKO-db-modules
OpenKO-db-modules is a c++ module for use in OpenKO projects.  It is largely generated by the jsonSchema in the OpenKO-db 
repository (see [OpenKO-db/jsonSchema](https://github.com/Open-KO/OpenKO-db/tree/master/jsonSchema)). 

## Doxygen
All classes in this module are generated with doxygen-compliant documentation comments.

You can view the Doxygen output here: [OpenKO Database Module Documentation](https://open-ko.github.io/OpenKO-db-modules).

The navigation for this site contains links to:

* the full model library, useful for looking up database table/column level documentation
* individual program model libaries, useful for subset documentation
* the stored procedure library for each database

## Module Structure

The following directories are code-generated and should not be directly modified, as they will be overwritten by 
subsequent codegens:

- AIServer: contains the minimum required subset of models/fields used in AIServer
- Aujard: contains the minimum required subset of models/fields used in Aujard
- Ebenezer: contains the minimum required subset of models/fields used in Ebenezer
- Full: contains a fully generated model representing the jsonSchema
- StoredProc: contains generated classes used to call the various stored procedures used in the server applications
- VersionManager: contains the minimum required subset of models/fields used in Version Manager

The following directories are hand-written code and safe to update/commit directly:

- ModelUtil:  model utility functions and types used by the model artifacts
- BinderUtil: binder utility functions and types used by the binder artifacts
